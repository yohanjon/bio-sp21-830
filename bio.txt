Hi my name is Jonathan Yohannes. I’ve lived in Seattle most of my life, and have the same Innovative mindset as our city. Through years of hard work in the construction field I picked up great skills that set me apart from the rest. From the meticulous projects with the Navy that highlighted my Diligence. To the mandatory overtime that displayed my Reliability. These strengths are what helped me excel in my last field and are keystones in my progress into the tech industry. I know with my skills I can be an asset to your company and I’d love to prove it to you.
