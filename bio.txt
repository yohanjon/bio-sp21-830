Hi my name is Jonathan Yohannes. 
I’ve lived in Seattle most of my life, and have the same innovative mindset as our city. 
Through years of hard work in the construction field I picked up great skills that set me apart from the rest.
From the meticulous projects with the Navy that highlighted my diligence. 
To the mandatory overtime that displayed my reliability. 
These strengths are what helped me excel in my last field, and are keystones in my progress into the tech industry. 
I know with my skills I can be an asset to your company and I’d love to prove it to you.

A little bit more about me, I love to play basketball.
Playing the team sport is my passion. 
Even if I'm not the one scoring everytime, being apart of the machine that is your team and getting the win is a feeling like no other.
I want you to know that I am the type to get whatever is asked of me done and as my top priority. 
I understand that I am an important piece for the team/organization and will do my best to get us the win!
